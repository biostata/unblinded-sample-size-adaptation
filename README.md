# Sample Size Recalculation, When and How?

`R` script files for reproducing the results (roughy ordered by section) are
available in the `R` folder.
The required dependencies can be installed using the
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) 
package and the provided lockfile `renv.lock`.
A bash script `run` to execute all code is provided. 
On Linux/Unix, execute 
```
./run
```
(might take a while).
Plots are stored in `output/figures`.
